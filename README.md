# New World AFK Preventer

A smart AFK prevention tool for New World that sends random key presses to prevent being kicked for inactivity.

## Features

- **Smart Key Algorithm**: Sends random movement keys (WASD, Space) at random intervals (3-8 minutes)
- **Configurable Hotkey**: Customize your own hotkey combination with hotkey recording
- **Window Detection**: Automatically detects if New World is running and visible
- **Tray Icon**: Minimizes to system tray with custom icon and menu options
- **Settings System**: Full settings management with JSON storage
- **Auto-Stop**: Automatically stops if New World window is closed or minimized
- **Bundled Icon**: Custom application icon automatically included in builds

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11
- .NET 6.0 or later (automatically checked by build script)
- New World game running

## Installation & Usage

### Quick Start (Recommended)

1. **Download the latest release:**
   - Go to [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/involvex/new-world-anti-afk/releases)
   - Download the latest `NewWorldAfkPreventer-vX.X.X.zip` file
   - Extract the ZIP to any folder

2. **Run the application:**
   - Double-click `NewWorldAfkPreventer.exe`
   - The app will start minimized to the system tray

3. **Start New World** and make sure it's visible on screen

4. **Toggle AFK prevention:**
   - Press **Ctrl+F12** (default hotkey) to start/stop
   - Or right-click the tray icon and select "Toggle AFK Prevention"
   - Or double-click the tray icon

5. **The application will:**
   - Send random key presses every 3-8 minutes (configurable)
   - Show notifications when starting/stopping (if enabled)
   - Display status in tray icon tooltip

## Settings & Configuration

Access the settings by right-clicking the tray icon and selecting "Settings". The settings window has three tabs:

### Hotkey Tab
- **Current Hotkey**: Shows the currently configured hotkey combination
- **Change Hotkey**: Opens a hotkey recorder to set a new key combination
- **Reset to Default**: Resets hotkey back to Ctrl+F12

### Timing Tab
- **Minimum Interval**: Set the minimum time between key presses (1-60 minutes)
- **Maximum Interval**: Set the maximum time between key presses (1-120 minutes)
- **Note**: The actual interval is randomized between these values

### General Tab
- **Start Minimized**: Application starts minimized to tray
- **Show Notifications**: Enable/disable balloon tip notifications

All settings are automatically saved to `settings.json` and persist between sessions.

## How It Works

1. **Window Detection**: Continuously monitors for the New World process
2. **Smart Timing**: Uses random intervals between min/max settings to avoid detection
3. **Key Selection**: Randomly selects from W, A, S, D, and Space keys
4. **Window Focus**: Brings New World to foreground before sending keys
5. **Auto-Management**: Automatically stops if New World closes

## Safety Features

- **Non-intrusive**: Only sends single key presses, doesn't interfere with gameplay
- **Random timing**: Varies intervals to appear more human-like
- **Window validation**: Only sends keys when New World is actually visible
- **Easy toggle**: Can be instantly stopped with hotkey or tray menu

## Troubleshooting

### Application won't start
- Make sure .NET 6.0+ is installed
- Run `dotnet --version` to check

### Hotkey not working
- Try clicking on the console window first
- Make sure no other application is using Ctrl+F12

### Keys not being sent
- Ensure New World is running and visible
- Check that the game window isn't minimized
- Look for tray icon notifications

### Build errors
- Update to .NET 6.0 or later
- Clean and rebuild: `dotnet clean && dotnet restore`
